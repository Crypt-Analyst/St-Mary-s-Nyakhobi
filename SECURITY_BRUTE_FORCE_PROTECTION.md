# Brute-Force Login Protection - Django-Axes

## Overview
St. Mary's School website now has **powerful protection against brute-force login attacks** using django-axes, an industry-standard security package trusted by thousands of Django applications worldwide.

## What This Protects Against
- **Password Guessing Attacks**: Attackers trying thousands of password combinations
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen username/password lists from other breaches
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Trying common passwords like "password123", "admin", etc.
- **Distributed Attacks**: Attackers using multiple IP addresses to avoid detection
- **Bot Attacks**: Automated scripts trying to break into accounts

## Security Features Enabled

### 1. Account Lockout (5 Failed Attempts)
- After **5 failed login attempts**, the account is locked for **1 hour**
- Applies to both admin portal and user logins
- Lockout message clearly informs the user: "Account locked: too many login attempts. Try again after 1 hour."

### 2. Username + IP Address Tracking
- Tracks both **username AND IP address together**
- This prevents attackers from:
  - Switching IP addresses to bypass lockout
  - Attacking multiple accounts from the same IP
  - Using VPNs to hide their location

**Example**: If attacker tries 5 failed logins for "admin" from IP 192.168.1.100, that specific combination is locked. But "admin" from a different IP or a different username from that IP can still attempt login (they have their own 5-attempt limit).

### 3. Automatic Counter Reset
- Successful login **resets the failed attempt counter**
- Encourages legitimate users who remember their password after a failed attempt
- Failed attempts during lockout do NOT extend the lockout period

### 4. Session Security Enhancements
- Sessions expire after **1 hour of inactivity**
- Sessions are extended automatically on user activity (prevents mid-work logouts)
- Cookies are HTTP-only (prevents JavaScript attacks/XSS)
- Cookies are marked secure in production (HTTPS only)

### 5. Detailed Logging
- All login attempts (successful and failed) are logged to the database
- Tracks:
  - Username attempted
  - IP address
  - Timestamp
  - User agent (browser/device)
  - Success/failure status
  - Number of failures for that username+IP combination

### 6. Reverse Proxy Support
- Configured for **Render deployment** with reverse proxy
- Correctly identifies real user IP addresses (not Render's proxy IP)
- Uses X-Forwarded-For headers properly

## How It Works

### Normal Login Process
1. User enters username and password
2. Django-axes checks if username+IP has any failed attempts
3. If less than 5 attempts, login proceeds normally
4. On success: Failed attempt counter is reset to 0
5. On failure: Counter increments by 1

### Lockout Process
1. User fails login 5 times from the same IP
2. Django-axes locks that username+IP combination
3. Further login attempts show: "Account locked: too many login attempts. Try again after 1 hour."
4. After 1 hour cooloff period, user can try again
5. Counter automatically resets after cooloff

### What Users See
- **1-4 failed attempts**: Normal error message "Invalid username or password"
- **5th failed attempt**: "Account locked: too many login attempts. Try again after 1 hour."
- **During lockout**: Same lockout message, no matter how many times they try
- **After 1 hour**: Can login normally again (counter reset)

## Configuration Settings
Located in `st_marys_school/settings.py` (lines 293-379):

```python
# Key Settings
AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = 5           # Lock after 5 failed attempts
AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = 1            # Lockout duration: 1 hour
AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS = [['username', 'ip_address']]  # Track both
AXES_RESET_ON_SUCCESS = True     # Reset on successful login
AXES_ONLY_ADMIN_SITE = False     # Protect all login pages
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 3600        # 1 hour session timeout
```

## Monitoring Failed Login Attempts

### View in Django Admin
1. Log into Django admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Navigate to **Axes** section
3. Click **Access attempts** to see all failed login attempts
4. Click **Access failure logs** to see lockout events
5. Click **Access logs** to see all login attempts (success + failure)

### What You'll See
- **Username**: Who tried to login
- **IP Address**: Where they tried from
- **Attempts left**: How many attempts remain before lockout
- **Locked out**: Whether currently locked
- **Timestamp**: When the attempt occurred
- **User agent**: Browser/device information

### Database Tables
Django-axes creates these tables in Supabase:
- `axes_accessattempt`: Current failed login attempts (cleared after success or cooloff)
- `axes_accesslog`: All login attempts (permanent log)
- `axes_accessfailurelog`: Lockout events only

## Manual Account Unlock

### Method 1: Django Admin
1. Go to Django admin → Axes → Access attempts
2. Find the locked username+IP combination
3. Click the checkbox next to it
4. Select "Delete selected access attempts" from dropdown
5. Click "Go" button
6. User can now login immediately

### Method 2: Django Shell
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
```python
from axes.models import AccessAttempt
# Unlock specific username
AccessAttempt.objects.filter(username='admin').delete()
# Or unlock specific IP
AccessAttempt.objects.filter(ip_address='192.168.1.100').delete()
# Or clear all locks
AccessAttempt.objects.all().delete()
```

### Method 3: Management Command
```bash
# Reset all axes attempts
python manage.py axes_reset
# Reset specific username
python manage.py axes_reset -u admin
# Reset specific IP
python manage.py axes_reset -i 192.168.1.100
```

## Testing the Protection

### Test 1: Basic Lockout
1. Go to admin login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Enter any username (e.g., "test")
3. Enter wrong password
4. Click login
5. Repeat 5 times total
6. On 5th attempt, should see: "Account locked: too many login attempts. Try again after 1 hour."

### Test 2: IP + Username Combination
1. Try logging in as "admin" with wrong password 5 times → Locked
2. Try logging in as "different_user" with wrong password → Should work (different username)
3. Use VPN or different device → Should work (different IP)

### Test 3: Reset on Success
1. Fail login 3 times
2. Enter correct password
3. Login succeeds
4. Try wrong password 5 times → Should lock (counter was reset)

### Test 4: Cooloff Period
1. Lock an account (5 failed attempts)
2. Wait 1 hour
3. Try logging in again → Should work (lock expired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Monitor attempts regularly**: Check axes_accesslog weekly for suspicious activity
2. **Investigate multiple lockouts**: If same username locked repeatedly, may indicate targeted attack
3. **Review IP patterns**: Multiple lockouts from same IP range = potential botnet
4. **Keep cooloff time**: 1 hour is recommended (too short = weak, too long = user frustration)
5. **Don't whitelist IPs**: Unless absolutely necessary (whitelist bypasses protection)

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords**: Minimum 8 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols
2. **Don't share passwords**: Each user should have unique credentials
3. **Reset forgotten passwords**: Don't guess repeatedly (causes self-lockout)
4. **Contact admin if locked**: If legitimately locked out, admin can manually unlock

## Adjusting Settings

### Change Attempt Limit
Edit `settings.py`:
```python
AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = 3  # Lock after 3 attempts (stricter)
AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = 10  # Lock after 10 attempts (more lenient)
```

### Change Lockout Duration
```python
AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = 0.5  # 30 minutes
AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = 24   # 24 hours (very strict)
```

### Track by IP Only (Not Recommended)
```python
AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS = [['ip_address']]  # Lock entire IP after 5 attempts
```

### Track by Username Only (Not Recommended)
```python
AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS = [['username']]  # Lock username globally (from any IP)
```

### Disable for Development
```python
AXES_ENABLED = False  # Temporarily disable axes
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (No Protection)
- ❌ Attackers could try **unlimited passwords**
- ❌ Bots could run **millions of attempts per day**
- ❌ No logging of failed attempts
- ❌ No way to detect or block attacks
- ❌ Weak accounts (like "admin" with "password") easily compromised

### AFTER (Django-Axes Enabled)
- ✅ Attackers limited to **5 attempts per hour** per IP
- ✅ Bots locked out after **5 attempts** (1 hour delay per attempt)
- ✅ Complete logging of all attempts with IP/timestamp
- ✅ Real-time detection and blocking of attacks
- ✅ Even weak passwords protected (though strong passwords still recommended)
- ✅ Distributed attacks slowed down (attacker needs new IP every 5 attempts)

### Attack Time Calculation
**Without protection**: 1 million password attempts = ~1 hour with fast bot
**With django-axes**: 1 million password attempts = ~11,415 years (5 attempts per hour, need 200,000 IP addresses)

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Legitimate user locked out after forgetting password
**Solution**: Admin manually unlocks via Django admin or `axes_reset` command

**Issue**: Lockout message not showing
**Solution**: Check that `AxesStandaloneBackend` is FIRST in `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`

**Issue**: Wrong IP address logged (shows Render's proxy IP)
**Solution**: Already configured with `AXES_IPWARE_PROXY_COUNT = 1`

**Issue**: Want to exclude specific IP from lockout
**Solution**: Add to whitelist (not recommended for security):
```python
AXES_NEVER_LOCKOUT_WHITELIST = True
AXES_IP_WHITELIST = ['192.168.1.100']
```
