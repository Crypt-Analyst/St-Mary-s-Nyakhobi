# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - Not Found Error

## ❌ The Problem

Your Render deployment is using **OLD CODE** (commit `f2c522fc`) instead of the latest code with all fixes!

**Current deployed commit:** `f2c522fc` (OLD - before admin portal)  
**Latest commit on GitHub:** `690d602` (NEW - with all fixes)

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX (Choose One Option)

### OPTION 1: Manual Redeploy (FASTEST - 30 seconds)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Click on your service** (st-marys-nyakhobi or whatever it's called)

3. **Click "Manual Deploy" button** (top right)
   - Select: **"Clear build cache & deploy"**

4. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for rebuild

✅ This will pull the latest code from GitHub!

---

### OPTION 2: Delete & Recreate Service (CLEANEST)

If Manual Deploy doesn't work, do a fresh setup:

#### Step 1: Delete Current Service
1. Render Dashboard → Click your service
2. Settings → Scroll to bottom
3. **"Delete Web Service"**
4. Confirm deletion

#### Step 2: Create NEW Web Service

**Use the SINGLE-LINE build command (most reliable):**

1. **Click "New +" → "Web Service"**

2. **Connect Repository:**
   - Repo: `Crypt-Analyst/St-Mary-s-Nyakhobi`
   - Branch: `master`
   - ✅ Make sure it shows latest commit: `690d602`

3. **Configuration:**

   **Name:**
   ```
   st-marys-nyakhobi
   ```

   **Runtime:**
   ```
   Python 3
   ```

   **Build Command:** (Copy this ENTIRE line - no line breaks!)
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input && python manage.py migrate
   ```

   **Start Command:**
   ```bash
   gunicorn st_marys_school.wsgi:application
   ```

   **Root Directory:**
   ```
   (Leave blank)
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**

   Click "Advanced" → Add these 4 variables:

   **1. PYTHON_VERSION**
   ```
   Key: PYTHON_VERSION
   Value: 3.13.4
   ```

   **2. SECRET_KEY**
   ```
   Key: SECRET_KEY
   Value: Click "Generate" button
   ```

   **3. DEBUG**
   ```
   Key: DEBUG
   Value: False
   ```

   **4. ALLOWED_HOSTS**
   ```
   Key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
   Value: .onrender.com
   ```

5. **Select Free Plan**

6. **Click "Create Web Service"**

---

## 📊 Verify You're Using Latest Code

**In Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment:**

Look for a section that shows the Git commit being deployed.

**Should see:**
```
✅ Commit: 690d602... (latest)
```

**NOT:**
```
❌ Commit: f2c522f... (old)
```

---

## 🎯 Why This Happened

Render sometimes caches the repository state. When you:
1. Created the service initially
2. It pulled commit `f2c522f`
3. You pushed new code (`690d602`)
4. But Render didn't automatically pull the update

**Solution:** Force a redeploy with latest code!

---

## ✅ After Successful Deployment

### 1. Check Build Logs

**Should see:**
```
==> Checking out commit 690d602... (NEW - this is correct!)
==> Installing Python version 3.13.4...
==> Installing dependencies...
✅ Successfully installed Django-4.2.7 Pillow-10.4.0 ...
✅ Collecting static files... 174 files copied
✅ Running migrations... OK
✅ Build successful
✅ Deploy live
```

### 2. Test Your Site

**Homepage:**
```
https://your-app.onrender.com
```

Should see: ✅ Your school website (not "Not Found")

**Admin Portal:**
```
https://your-app.onrender.com/admin/
```

Should see: ✅ Django admin login page

### 3. Create Superuser

Once site is live:

1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Click **"Shell"** tab
3. Run:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Enter details:
```
Username: admin
Email: admin@stmarysnyakhobi.ac.ke
Password: [your secure password]
```

### 4. Login to Admin

Visit:
```
https://your-app.onrender.com/admin/
```

Login with credentials you just created.

You should see all **17 admin models**:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still shows old commit `f2c522f`

**Fix:**
1. Try "Clear build cache & deploy"
2. If that doesn't work, delete service and recreate

### Issue: Build fails with "Publish directory ./build.sh does not exist"

**Fix:**
Use the single-line build command instead:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input && python manage.py migrate
```

### Issue: "DisallowedHost" error

**Fix:**
Add environment variable:
```
Key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
Value: your-actual-app-name.onrender.com,.onrender.com
```

### Issue: Static files (CSS/JS) not loading

**Fix:**
Check build logs to ensure this command ran:
```
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
174 static files copied  ← Should see this
```
