## 🎯 Recommendation

Since you want a clean, focused admin portal, I'll:
1. ✅ Keep all current features (they're working)
2. ➕ Add the ESSENTIAL missing features from your list
3. ❌ Remove nothing (everything you have is useful)
4. 🎨 Organize better for easier navigation

## Next Steps

I'll create the following NEW models:
1. `HomePageBanner` - Homepage sliders/banners
2. `AcademicDepartment` - Departments and subjects
3. `AdmissionInfo` - Admission requirements
4. `ParentInfo` - Fees, policies, circulars for parents
5. `SchoolValue` - Core values display
6. `AdminActivityLog` - Track admin actions

This will give you COMPLETE control over ALL website content!
