## Admin Portal Updates Needed

### For Content Managers:

When adding new curriculum information or academic content:

1. **Old References**: Don't use "Form 1-4" anymore
2. **New References**: Use "Grade 10, 11, 12" or "Senior Secondary"
3. **Curriculum Model**: The dropdown now shows:
   - Grade 10 - Senior Secondary Year 1
   - Grade 11 - Senior Secondary Year 2
   - Grade 12 - Senior Secondary Year 3

### Sample Content Examples:

‚úÖ **Correct**:
- "Grade 10 students will study..."
- "Senior Secondary curriculum includes..."
- "Grade 12 KSCE candidates..."
- "Grade 11 specialization options..."

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- "Form 1 students..." 
- "8-4-4 system..."
- "Form 4 KCSE candidates..."
